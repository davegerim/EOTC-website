# EOTC | Sacred Heritage Narrative

> "Preserving the sacred legacy through digital reverence."

A high-fidelity digital museum and archive dedicated to the Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church (EOTC). This project treats web design not just as a medium for information, but as a vessel for spiritual storytelling.

## 🏛️ Project Vision
To bridge the gap between ancient tradition and modern digital artistry. The website uses cinematic motion, sacred Amharic typography, and immersive parallax effects to create a "Visual Chronicle" of one of Christianity's oldest traditions.

## ✨ Key Features
-   **Cinematic Hero:** "Sacred Ethiopian Legacy" entry with split-text reveal animations.
-   **Smooth Scrolling:** Integrated [Lenis](https://github.com/studio-freight/lenis) for a luxurious, fluid scroll experience.
-   **Interactive Heritage Timeline:** A horizontal journey through the Axumite, Zagwe, and Gondarian eras.
-   **The Scriptorium:** An interactive spotlight viewer for ancient manuscripts.
-   **Guardianship Modal:** A community engagement hub (Scribe, Witness, Steward) connecting users to the project.
-   **Bilingual Typography:** Seamless integration of *Manrope* (English) and *Noto Sans Ethiopic* (Amharic).

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
-   **Core:** HTML5, Modern CSS (Variables, Grid)
-   **Build Tool:** [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) (Multi-Page App configuration)
-   **Animation:** [GSAP](https://greensock.com/gsap/) (ScrollTrigger, Timeline)
-   **Smooth Scroll:** Lenis
